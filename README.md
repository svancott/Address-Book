Address Bloc is an address book application that runs in the terminal, built with ruby on rails.

It has all the functions that an address book needs:

* Create

* Read

* Update (edit)

* Destroy (delete)

Also known as **CRUD**

Building this app can help the beginner Ruby programmer learn how to use these fundamentals in a real world app.
